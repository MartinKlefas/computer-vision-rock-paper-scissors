# Computer Vision RPS

# Milestone 1
Setup the environment, and installed the required packages.

# Milestone 2

Created a simple TensorFlow model using Google Teachable Machine. This has been added to the project, but not yet linked in a meaningful way.
- Unfortunately teachable machine gave poor user feedback, which meant it looked like it had crashed a few times. Running overnight fixed this.
- creating a model via tflite model maker was also considered, but this seems to only run on docker and linux.
    - next step is to try this out by making a docker, or imaging  a local machine to linux

# Milestone 3

Download a simplified test case to check model predictions
Changed model output to be more human readable by interrogating the numpy array that the predictor produces.
